Exploring the aviability of water quality data in the columbia River Basin using the USGS dataRetrieval package. The dataRetrieval package "The package allows users to easily access data stored in the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) and the multi-agency database, Water Quality Portal (WQP). NWIS only contains data collected by or for the USGS. Conversely, WQP is a database that aggregates water quality data from multiple agencies, including USGS, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and many state, tribal, and local agencies."
